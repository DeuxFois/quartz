# Block Elements Characteristics

A block element has the following characteristics:

- It always begins on a new line
- Its `height`, `line-height`, `top-margin` and `bottom-margin` can be specified
- Its width defaults to 100% of its containing element, unless otherwise specified

Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<form>`, `<ul>` and `<li>`.

Most of the newer tags, such as `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<main>` etc. are also displayed as `block` by default.
