Hi âœŒ Welcome on my second brain !  
I'm a passionate CS french student.  
I began to save my notes with markdown, that is often called "second brain", for better understanding of studied concepts and for fastly remember notion (but i use obsidian for that, not notion lol)  
So, there is the topics

# web
I like web developpement, it's modern, graphical and often fast for creating beautifull applications with live preview.  
I have the feeling that React is the most appreciated framework, and it's pretty cool, easy to apprehend and fast to code.

# ML and IA
I studied machine learning at my first year in Masted and i completed my learning by following Stanford CS221.  
I think it's important to have a well understanding og mathematical concept behind Machine learning's alrgorithms, because It's a rapidly evolving field and future algorithms will surely be based on same mathematical and statistical domains.

# Database
In my first year of Master i had to write a paper of 15 pages of a chosen subject from a list.
So i chose Databases.
I like to learn about fetching, store and interpret datas. So i use a lot of database. But for creating a database, I prefer NoSQL because the proof of viability   
Database

# Programming Architecture

I love programming, and i start to create big project and think about the architecture of my software. I haven't learn that in my studies, because i chose Mathematical and Computer Science, but i'm interested about creating many modules in a software.

# Master
In last, there is some note of my Master. I moved Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence in a whole part and i don't write markdown notes in some courses, like bigdata where we have paper support.
