Hi âœŒ Welcome to my second brain !  
I'm an passionate french CS student.  
I started to save my notes with markdown in 2021, to better understand the studied concepts and to remember quickly the notions (but i use obsidian for that, not notion lol)  
<br />
So, there is the topics

## [Web and Network](Web-and-Network.md)
I like web developpement, it's modern, graphical and often fast to create beautiful applications with live preview.  
I feel like React is the most popular framework, and it's pretty cool, easy to learn and fast to work with.

## [ML and AI](Datas.md)
I studied machine learning at my first year of my Master's degree and completed my learning by taking the Stanford CS221 course on youtube.  
I think it's important to have a well understanding of the mathematical concept behind machine learning algorithms, because it is a rapidly evolving field and future algorithms will surely be based on the same mathematical and statistical areas.


## Database
In the first year of my Master's degree, I had to write a 15-page paper on a topic chosen from a list.
I chose databases.  
I like to learn about fetching, store and interpret datas. So i use a lot of database. But for creating a database, I prefer NoSQL because the proof of viability   
Database

## [Software architecture](Architecture/Design_Pattern/Sommaire.md)
I like programming, and i'm starting to create big project and thinking about the architecture of my software. I didn't learn this in my studies, as I chose mathematics and computer science, but I am interested in creating many modules in a software, from back to front.  


## [Master](Master.md)
Finally, here are some notes from my master's degree. I moved machine learning and artificial intelligence into a whole section and didn't write markdown notes in some courses, like bigdata where we have paper support.
