[supervised-learning](data-science/machine-learning/supervised-learning.md) is defined by its use of **labeled datasets**. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.  
Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems : **classification** and **regression**.

<br/>

[unsupervised-learning](data-science/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning.md) uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster **unlabeled datasets**. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are “unsupervised”).  
Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: **clustering**, **association** and **dimensionality reduction**.

 Otherwise, we have two categories of algorithms : [generative and discriminative](data-science/machine-learning/generative-vs-discriminative.md), for resume : A discriminative algorithm does not care about how the data was generated, contrary to generative who try to categorize signals based on your generation assumptions
