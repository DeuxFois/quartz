## Probability

Probability is the likelihood of an event. To define an event, we use **random variables** in a **sample space**, who can be a **continuous** ($x \in \mathbb{R}$) or **discrete** set ($x \in \mathbb{N }$) .


 For example, the random variable that represents a number obtained when rolling a dice would take values from 1 to 6. Set of numbers from 1 to 6 is called sample space. We can talk about the probability of a random variable taking a certain value, for example P(X=3)=1/6.

## Statistic 

Statistic is the science of analizying data. 
More fomally that's the "set of mathematical interpretation techniques applied to phenomena for which an exhaustive study of all factors is impossible"

It's about compute the Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation and Mode, Medidian Quartiles.
Also the covariance and correlation.
Finally The P-value and confidence intervals
