## Introduction

Once data has been [loaded in an OpenGL buffer](http://www.haroldserrano.com/blog/loading-vertex-normal-and-uv-data-onto-opengl-buffers) and the [rendering sequence started](http://www.haroldserrano.com/blog/starting-the-primitive-rendering-process-in-opengl), the OpenGL rendering pipeline is started. The rendering pipeline is responsible for assembling the vertices of a character, apply a texture, converting the vertices to the right coordinate system and displaying the character on the default framebuffer, i.e, the screen.

The OpenGL rendering pipeline consists of six stages:

- Per-Vertex Operation
- Primitive Assembly
- Primitive Processing
- Rasterization
- Fragment Processing
- Per-Fragment Operation

### Per-Vertex Operation

In the first stage, called **Per-Vertex Operation**, vertices are processed by a shader, known as the **Vertex Shader**.

Each vertex is multiplied with a transformation matrix, effectively changing its 3D coordinate system to a new *coordinate system*. Just like a photographic camera transforms a 3D scenery into a 2D photograph. The *Vertex Shader* changes the 3D coordinate system of a cube into a projective coordinate system.

### Primitive Assembly

After three vertices have been processed by the vertex shader, they are taken to the **Primitive Assembly** stage.

This is where a **primitive** is constructed by connecting the vertices in a specified order.

### Primitive Processing

Before the primitive is taken to the next stage, **Clipping** occurs. Any primitive that falls outside the **View-Volume**, i.e. outside the screen, is *clipped* and ignore in the next stage.

### Rasterization

What you ultimately see on a screen are pixels approximating the shape of a primitive. This approximation occurs in the **Rasterization** stage. In this stage, pixels are tested to see if they are inside the primitiveâ€™s perimeter. If they are not, they are discarded.

If they are within the primitive, they are taken to the next stage. The set of pixels that passed the test is called a **fragment**.

### Fragment Processing

A **Fragment** is a set of pixels approximating the shape of a primitive. When a fragment leaves the rasterization stage, it is taken to the **Per-Fragment** stage, where it is received by a **shader**.

This shader is called a **Fragment Shader** and its responsibility is to apply *color* or a *texture* to the pixels within the fragment.

### Per-Fragment Operation

Before the pixels in the fragment are sent to the framebuffer, fragments are submitted to several tests like:

- Pixel Ownership test
- Scissor test
- Alpha test
- Stencil test
- Depth test

At the end of the pipeline, the pixels are saved in a **Framebuffer**, more specifically the **Default-Framebuffer**. These are the pixels that you see in your mobile screen.
