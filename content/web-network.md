# Network
It is the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.  
For this purpose, we need a **protocol**, a set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network.


**[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](web-network/http.md)** is an **application-layer protocol** for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. 
HTTP follows a classical **client-server model**, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a **stateless protocol**, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

# Web 
**[MDN](web-network/MDN.md)** (Mozilla Developer Network) is a community site for documentation and tutorials on Web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the HTTP protocol.   
Its content is maintained by employees and volunteers of Mozilla and Google

<br/>

**[HTML (HyperText Markup Language) ](web-network/html.md)**  is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

**[CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) ](web-network/css.md)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

<br/>

**[JavaScript (JS)](web-network/modern-javascript.md)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments

<br/>

**[Node.js](web-network/node.md)** is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.
