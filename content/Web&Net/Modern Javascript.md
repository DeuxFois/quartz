# Notions
## Destructuring objects and arrays

*Destructuring* is a convenient way of creating new variables by extracting some values from data stored in objects or arrays.

To name a few use cases, *destructuring* can be used to destructure function parameters or *this.props* in React projects for instance.

### Explanation with sample code

- Object

Let’s consider the following object for all the samples:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Nick",
  lastName: "Anderson",
  age: 35,
  sex: "M"
}
```

Without destructuring

```js
const nickname = person.firstName;
const age = person.age;
const city = person.city || "Paris";
```

With destructuring, all in one line:

```js
const { firstName: nickname, age, city = "Paris" } = person; // That's it !
```

<br/>

Destructuring is even more pleasant to use with arrow functions :

```js
const joinFirstLastName = ({ firstName, lastName }) => firstName + '-' + lastName;

joinFirstLastName(person); // "Nick-Anderson"
```

- Array

Let’s consider the following array:

```js
const myArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
```

Without destructuring

```js
const x = myArray[0];
const y = myArray[1];
```

With destructuring

```js
const [x, y] = myArray; // That's it !

console.log(x) // "a"
console.log(y) // "b"
```

## Array methods - map / filter / reduce / find

*Map*, *filter*, *reduce* and *find* are array methods that are coming from a programming paradigm named [*functional programming*](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0).

To sum it up:

- **Array.prototype.map()** does something on each elements
- **Array.prototype.filter()** decides element by element if it should keep it
- **Array.prototype.reduce()** aggregates the elements into a single value
- **Array.prototype.find()** returns the first element that satisfies the provided condition.

I recommend to use them as much as possible in following the principles of functional programming because they are composable, concise and elegant.

With those four methods, you can avoid the use of *for* and *forEach* loops in most situations. When you are tempted to do a *for* loop, try to do it with *map*, *filter*, *reduce* and *find* composed. You might struggle to do it at first because it requires you to learn a new way of thinking, but once you’ve got it things get easier.

#### Sample code

```js
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(n => n * 2); // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // [0, 2, 4, 6]
const sum = numbers.reduce((prev, next) => prev + next, 0); // 21
const greaterThanFour = numbers.find((n) => n>4); // 5
```

Compute total grade sum for students with grades 10 or above by composing map, filter and reduce:

```js
const students = [
  { name: "Nick", grade: 10 },
  { name: "John", grade: 15 },
  { name: "Julia", grade: 19 },
  { name: "Nathalie", grade: 9 },
];

const aboveTenSum = students
  .map(student => student.grade) // we map the students array to an array of their grades
  .filter(grade => grade >= 10) // we filter the grades array to keep those 10 or above
  .reduce((prev, next) => prev + next, 0); // we sum all the grades 10 or above one by one

console.log(aboveTenSum) // 44 -- 10 (Nick) + 15 (John) + 19 (Julia), Nathalie below 10 is ignored
```


## Spread operator “…”

The spread operator `...` has been introduced with ES2015 and is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into places where multiple elements can fit.

### Sample code

```js
const arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
const arr2 = [...arr1, "d", "e", "f"]; // ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
```

### Explanation

#### In iterables (like arrays)

If we have the two following arrays:

```js
const arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
const arr2 = [arr1, "d", "e", "f"]; // [["a", "b", "c"], "d", "e", "f"]
```

*arr2* the first element is an array because *arr1* is injected as is into *arr2*. But what we want is *arr2* to be an array of letters. To do so, we can *spread* the elements of *arr1* into *arr2*.

With spread operator

```js
const arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
const arr2 = [...arr1, "d", "e", "f"]; // ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
```

#### Function rest parameter

In function parameters, we can use the rest operator to inject parameters into an array we can loop in. There is already an **arguments** object bound to every function that is equal to an array of all the parameters passed into the function.

```js
function myFunc() {
  for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    console.log(arguments[i]);
  }
}

myFunc("Nick", "Anderson", 10, 12, 6);
// "Nick"
// "Anderson"
// 10
// 12
// 6
```

But let’s say that we want this function to create a new student with its grades and with its average grade. Wouldn’t it be more convenient to extract the first two parameters into two separate variables, and then have all the grades in an array we can iterate over?

That’s exactly what the rest operator allows us to do!

```js
function createStudent(firstName, lastName, ...grades) {
  // firstName = "Nick"
  // lastName = "Anderson"
  // [10, 12, 6] -- "..." takes all other parameters passed and creates a "grades" array variable that contains them

  const avgGrade = grades.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0) / grades.length; // computes average grade from grades

  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    grades: grades,
    avgGrade: avgGrade
  }
}

const student = createStudent("Nick", "Anderson", 10, 12, 6);
console.log(student);
// {
//   firstName: "Nick",
//   lastName: "Anderson",
//   grades: [10, 12, 6],
//   avgGrade: 9,33
// }
```

> **Note:** createStudent function is bad because we don’t check if grades.length exists or is different from 0. But it’s easier to read this way, so I didn’t handle this case.

#### Object properties spreading

For this one, I recommend you read previous explanations about the rest operator on iterables and function parameters.

```js
const myObj = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
const { x, y, ...z } = myObj; // object destructuring here
console.log(x); // 1
console.log(y); // 2
console.log(z); // { a: 3, b: 4 }

// z is the rest of the object destructured: myObj object minus x and y properties destructured

const n = { x, y, ...z };
console.log(n); // { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 }

// Here z object properties are spread into n
```

## Promises

A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function ([ref](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261#3cd0)).

Promises can be used to avoid [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/), and they are more and more frequently encountered in modern JavaScript projects.

### Sample code

```js
const fetchingPosts = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  $.get("/posts")
    .done(posts => res(posts))
    .fail(err => rej(err));
});

fetchingPosts
  .then(posts => console.log(posts))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

### Explanation

When you do an *Ajax request* the response is not synchronous because you want a resource that takes some time to come. It even may never come if the resource you have requested is unavailable for some reason (404).

To handle that kind of situation, ES2015 has given us *promises*. Promises can have three different states:

- Pending
- Fulfilled
- Rejected

Let’s say we want to use promises to handle an Ajax request to fetch the resource X.

#### Create the promise

We firstly are going to create a promise. We will use the jQuery get method to do our Ajax request to X.

```js
const xFetcherPromise = new Promise( // Create promise using "new" keyword and store it into a variable
  function(resolve, reject) { // Promise constructor takes a function parameter which has resolve and reject parameters itself
    $.get("X") // Launch the Ajax request
      .done(function(X) { // Once the request is done...
        resolve(X); // ... resolve the promise with the X value as parameter
      })
      .fail(function(error) { // If the request has failed...
        reject(error); // ... reject the promise with the error as parameter
      });
  }
)
```

As seen in the above sample, the Promise object takes an *executor* function which takes two parameters **resolve** and **reject**. Those parameters are functions which when called are going to move the promise *pending* state to respectively a *fulfilled* and *rejected* state.

The promise is in pending state after instance creation and its *executor* function is executed immediately. Once one of the function *resolve* or *reject* is called in the *executor* function, the promise will call its associated handlers.

#### Promise handlers usage

To get the promise result (or error), we must attach to it handlers by doing the following:

```js
xFetcherPromise
  .then(function(X) {
    console.log(X);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.log(err)
  })
```

If the promise succeeds, *resolve* is executed and the function passed as `.then` parameter is executed.

If it fails, *reject* is executed and the function passed as `.catch` parameter is executed.

> **Note :** If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached. [(Ref: MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#Description)

## Imports / Exports

ES6 modules are used to access variables or functions in a module explicitly exported by the modules it imports.

I highly recommend to take a look at MDN resources on import/export (see external resources below), it is both straightforward and complete.

#### Explanation with sample code

#### Named exports

Named exports are used to export several values from a module.

> **Note :** You can only name-export [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen) that have a name.

```js
// mathConstants.js
export const pi = 3.14;
export const exp = 2.7;
export const alpha = 0.35;

// -------------

// myFile.js
import { pi, exp } from './mathConstants.js'; // Named import -- destructuring-like syntax
console.log(pi) // 3.14
console.log(exp) // 2.7

// -------------

// mySecondFile.js
import * as constants from './mathConstants.js'; // Inject all exported values into constants variable
console.log(constants.pi) // 3.14
console.log(constants.exp) // 2.7
```

While named imports looks like *destructuring*, they have a different syntax and are not the same. They don’t support default values nor *deep* destructuring.

Besides, you can do aliases but the syntax is different from the one used in destructuring:

```js
import { foo as bar } from 'myFile.js'; // foo is imported and injected into a new bar variable
```

#### Default import / export

Concerning the default export, there is only a single default export per module. A default export can be a function, a class, an object or anything else. This value is considered the “main” exported value since it will be the simplest to import. [Ref: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#Description)

```js
// coolNumber.js
const ultimateNumber = 42;
export default ultimateNumber;

// ------------

// myFile.js
import number from './coolNumber.js';
// Default export, independently from its name, is automatically injected into number variable;
console.log(number) // 42
```

Function exporting:

```js
// sum.js
export default function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
// -------------

// myFile.js
import sum from './sum.js';
const result = sum(1, 2);
console.log(result) // 3
```

## Async Await

In addition to Promises, there is a new syntax you might encounter to handle asynchronous code named *async / await*.

The purpose of async/await functions is to simplify the behavior of using promises synchronously and to perform some behavior on a group of Promises. Just as Promises are similar to structured callbacks, async/await is similar to combining generators and promises. Async functions *always* return a Promise. ([Ref: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function))

> **Note :** You must understand what promises are and how they work before trying to understand async / await since they rely on it.

> **Note 2:** [*await* must be used in an *async* function](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9#f3f0), which means that you can’t use await in the top level of our code since that is not inside an async function.

### Sample code

```js
async function getGithubUser(username) { // async keyword allows usage of await in the function and means function returns a promise
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`); // Execution is paused here until the Promise returned by fetch is resolved
  return response.json();
}

getGithubUser('mbeaudru')
  .then(user => console.log(user)) // logging user response - cannot use await syntax since this code isn't in async function
  .catch(err => console.log(err)); // if an error is thrown in our async function, we will catch it here
```

### Explanation with sample code

*Async / Await* is built on promises but they allow a more imperative style of code.

The *async* operator marks a function as asynchronous and will always return a *Promise*. You can use the *await* operator in an *async* function to pause execution on that line until the returned Promise from the expression either resolves or rejects.

```js
async function myFunc() {
  // we can use await operator because this function is async
  return "hello world";
}

myFunc().then(msg => console.log(msg)) // "hello world" -- myFunc's return value is turned into a promise because of async operator
```

When the *return* statement of an async function is reached, the Promise is fulfilled with the value returned. If an error is thrown inside an async function, the Promise state will turn to *rejected*. If no value is returned from an async function, a Promise is still returned and resolves with no value when execution of the async function is complete.

*await* operator is used to wait for a *Promise* to be fulfilled and can only be used inside an *async* function body. When encountered, the code execution is paused until the promise is fulfilled.

> **Note :** *fetch* is a function that returns a Promise that allows to do an AJAX request

Let’s see how we could fetch a github user with promises first:

```js
function getGithubUser(username) {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`).then(response => response.json());
}

getGithubUser('mbeaudru')
  .then(user => console.log(user))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

Here’s the *async / await* equivalent:

```js
async function getGithubUser(username) { // promise + await keyword usage allowed
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`); // Execution stops here until fetch promise is fulfilled
  return response.json();
}

getGithubUser('mbeaudru')
  .then(user => console.log(user))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

*async / await* syntax is particularly convenient when you need to chain promises that are interdependent.

For instance, if you need to get a token in order to be able to fetch a blog post on a database and then the author informations:

> **Note :** *await* expressions needs to be wrapped in parentheses to call its resolved value’s methods and properties on the same line.

```js
async function fetchPostById(postId) {
  const token = (await fetch('token_url')).json().token;
  const post = (await fetch(`/posts/${postId}?token=${token}`)).json();
  const author = (await fetch(`/users/${post.authorId}`)).json();

  post.author = author;
  return post;
}

fetchPostById('gzIrzeo64')
  .then(post => console.log(post))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

#### Error handling

Unless we add *try / catch* blocks around *await* expressions, uncaught exceptions – regardless of whether they were thrown in the body of your *async* function or while it’s suspended during *await* – will reject the promise returned by the *async* function. Using the `throw` statement in an async function is the same as returning a Promise that rejects. [(Ref: PonyFoo)](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await#error-handling).

> **Note :** Promises behave the same!

With promises, here is how you would handle the error chain:

```js
function getUser() { // This promise will be rejected!
  return new Promise((res, rej) => rej("User not found !"));
}

function getAvatarByUsername(userId) {
  return getUser(userId).then(user => user.avatar);
}

function getUserAvatar(username) {
  return getAvatarByUsername(username).then(avatar => ({ username, avatar }));
}

getUserAvatar('mbeaudru')
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err)); // "User not found !"
```

The equivalent with *async / await*:

```js
async function getUser() { // The returned promise will be rejected!
  throw "User not found !";
}

async function getAvatarByUsername(userId) => {
  const user = await getUser(userId);
  return user.avatar;
}

async function getUserAvatar(username) {
  var avatar = await getAvatarByUsername(username);
  return { username, avatar };
}

getUserAvatar('mbeaudru')
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err)); // "User not found !"
```

## Truthy / Falsy

In JavaScript, a truthy or falsy value is a value that is being casted into a boolean when evaluated in a boolean context. An example of boolean context would be the evaluation of an `if` condition:

Every value will be casted to `true` unless they are equal to:

- `false`
- `0`
- `""` (empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

Here are examples of *boolean context*:

- `if` condition evaluation

```js
if (myVar) {}
```

`myVar` can be any [first-class citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen) (variable, function, boolean) but it will be casted into a boolean because it’s evaluated in a boolean context.

- After logical **NOT** `!` operator

This operator returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

```js
!0 // true -- 0 is falsy so it returns true
!!0 // false -- 0 is falsy so !0 returns true so !(!0) returns false
!!"" // false -- empty string is falsy so NOT (NOT false) equals false
```

- With the *Boolean* object constructor

```js
new Boolean(0) // false
new Boolean(1) // true
```

- In a ternary evaluation

```js
myVar ? "truthy" : "falsy"
```

myVar is evaluated in a boolean context.

Be careful when comparing 2 values. The object values (that should be cast to true) is **not** being casted to Boolean but it forced to convert into a primitive value one using [ToPrimitives specification](http://javascript.info/object-toprimitive). Internally, when an object is compared to Boolean value like `[] == true`, it does `[].toString() == true` so…

```js
let a = [] == true // a is false since [].toString() give "" back.
let b = [1] == true // b is true since [1].toString() give "1" back.
let c = [2] == true // c is false since [2].toString() give "2" back.
```

## Anamorphisms and Catamorphisms

### Anamorphisms

Anamorphisms are functions that map from some object to a more complex structure containing the type of the object. It is the process of *unfolding* a simple structure into a more complex one. Consider unfolding an integer to a list of integers. The integer is our initial object and the list of integers is the more complex structure.

**Sample code**

```js
function downToOne(n) {
  const list = [];

  for (let i = n; i > 0; --i) {
    list.push(i);
  }

  return list;
}

downToOne(5)
  //=> [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
```

### Catamorphisms

Catamorphisms are the opposite of Anamorphisms, in that they take objects of more complex structure and *fold* them into simpler structures. Take the following example `product` which take a list of integers and returns a single integer.

**Sample code**

```js
function product(list) {
  let product = 1;

  for (const n of list) {
    product = product * n;
  }

  return product;
}

product(downToOne(5)) // 120
```

- [Anamorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphism)
- [Catamorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamorphism)

## Generators

Another way to write the `downToOne` function is to use a Generator. To instantiate a `Generator` object, one must use the `function *` declaration. Generators are functions that can be exited and later re-entered with its context (variable bindings) saved across re-entrances.

For example, the `downToOne` function above can be rewritten as:

```js
function * downToOne(n) {
  for (let i = n; i > 0; --i) {
    yield i;
  }
}

[...downToOne(5)] // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
```

Generators return an iterable object. When the iterator’s `next()` function is called, it is executed until the first `yield` expression, which specifies the value to be returned from the iterator or with `yield*`, which delegates to another generator function. When a `return` expression is called in the generator, it will mark the generator as done and pass back as the return value. Further calls to `next()` will not return any new values.

**Sample code**

```js
// Yield Example
function * idMaker() {
  var index = 0;
  while (index < 2) {
    yield index;
    index = index + 1;
  }
}

var gen = idMaker();

gen.next().value; // 0
gen.next().value; // 1
gen.next().value; // undefined
```

The `yield*` expression enables a generator to call another generator function during iteration.

```js
// Yield * Example
function * genB(i) {
  yield i + 1;
  yield i + 2;
  yield i + 3;
}

function * genA(i) {
  yield i;
  yield* genB(i);
  yield i + 10;
}

var gen = genA(10);

gen.next().value; // 10
gen.next().value; // 11
gen.next().value; // 12
gen.next().value; // 13
gen.next().value; // 20
```

```js
// Generator Return Example
function* yieldAndReturn() {
  yield "Y";
  return "R";
  yield "unreachable";
}

var gen = yieldAndReturn()
gen.next(); // { value: "Y", done: false }
gen.next(); // { value: "R", done: true }
gen.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

## Static Methods

### Short explanation

The `static` keyword is used in classes to declare static methods. Static methods are functions in a class that belongs to the class object and are not available to any instance of that class.

### Sample code

```js
class Repo {
  static getName() {
    return "Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet"
  }
}

// Note that we did not have to create an instance of the Repo class
console.log(Repo.getName()) // Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet

let r = new Repo();
console.log(r.getName()) // Uncaught TypeError: r.getName is not a function

Static methods can be called within another static method by using the `this` keyword, this doesn’t work for non-static methods though. Non-static methods cannot directly access static methods using the `this` keyword.

##### Calling other static methods from a static method.

To call a static method from another static method, the `this` keyword can be used like so;

```js
class Repo {
  static getName() {
    return "Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet"
  }

  static modifyName() {
    return this.getName() + '-added-this'
  }
}

console.log(Repo.modifyName()) // Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet-added-this
```

#### Calling static methods from non-static methods.

Non-static methods can call static methods in 2 ways;

1.  ###### Using the class name.
    

To get access to a static method from a non-static method we use the class name and call the static method like a property. e.g `ClassName.StaticMethodName`

```js
class Repo {
  static getName() {
    return "Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet"
  }

  useName() {
    return Repo.getName() + ' and it contains some really important stuff'
  }
}

// we need to instantiate the class to use non-static methods
let r = new Repo()
console.log(r.useName()) // Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet and it contains some really important stuff
```

2.  ##### Using the constructor
    

Static methods can be called as properties on the constructor object.

```js
class Repo {
  static getName() {
    return "Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet"
  }

  useName() {
    // Calls the static method as a property of the constructor
    return this.constructor.getName() + ' and it contains some really important stuff'
  }
}

// we need to instantiate the class to use non-static methods
let r = new Repo()
console.log(r.useName()) // Repo name is modern-js-cheatsheet and it contains some really important stuff
```
